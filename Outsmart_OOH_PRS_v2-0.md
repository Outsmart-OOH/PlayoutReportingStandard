# Introduction

The agreed Reporting standard impacts any business that sends, receives or processes OOH reports. This
includes Media Owners, Specialists, Agencies and technology providers.

The document refers to a set of 6 _Reporting Levels_ that share the granularity and accountability of the type of
reporting that can be produced by a company. – A further update to this document is expected to cover Level 6
in more detail in the future.

The final part of this document sets out the expected _Data Standards_ of how this data should be provided, for
those companies sending or receiving this data between them.

The following document is a guideline that covers the minimum detail required and future revisions to this
document may add additional requirements.


Assets: Definitions

SPACE is the industry database of OOH advertising assets.

The structure and scope of the database is defined by the OOH Standards Committee.

Every OOH asset held within the database is ascribed a unique reference number (Frame ID).

The characteristics of each asset are held within the database and subject to the agreed definitions.


Reporting Levels

This table sets out the attributes that differentiate the types of standard report.

Further work is to be undertaken on Level 6 to standardise transmission of Playout level data.


The “Summary Report” Data Standard

This is the standard for day/hour specific reporting that can be shared with customers to report on order-
specific campaign delivery.

The attached examples assume that they are accompanied by an Order ID that references that specific
campaign.

The “Playout Report” Data standard

This is the standard for reporting on the display of campaigns that can be shared with customers if more
granular detail is required.
